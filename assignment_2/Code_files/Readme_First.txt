ALL the subparts of each questions are in jupyter notebook (q-1,q-2,q-3) : 
        
        -They include all the graph work
        -They include all the observations and results
    


The files taking command line arguments are :
    
    
    1) KNN - q-1-1.py : python3 q-1-1.py 0/1/2 testfile    ( 0 for iris , 1 for robot 1 , 2 for robot 2)
    
    2) Naive Bayes - q-2.py : python3 q-2.py testfile
    
    3) Linear Regression - q-3-1.py : python3 q-3-1.py testfile
    
    
 **I assumed all the test files does not have output labels and rest all lables as it is  AND output will be output lables for each class**
